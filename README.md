# What is this ?
This is my second attempt at making a portofolio. My first attempt was during my early days as a web developer (when I was still at BeCode). You can see my old portofolio on my github or on this link :
https://jean-oikonomou.github.io/PORTOFOLIO/

This time I won't use any external libraries. Only HTML/CSS/JS. This is a first attempt before making my portofolio using React / Next and some other surprises :)
