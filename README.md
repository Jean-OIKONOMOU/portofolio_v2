# What is this ?
This is my second attempt at making a portofolio. My first attempt was during my early days as a web developer (when I was still at BeCode). You can see my old portofolio on my github or on this link :
https://jean-oikonomou.github.io/PORTOFOLIO/

This time I won't use any external libraries. Only HTML/CSS/JS. This is a first attempt before making my portofolio using React / Next and some other surprises :)

# Why not directly do a portofolio in React/Next then ?
Because :
- I want to have a quick recap of HTML/CSS/JS.
- I want to upgrade my basic web developer skills by making stuff I've never done before.
- I want to use BEM notation correctly for once.
- I want to make a sort of "sketch" for the bigger project up ahead. But a sketch that is alive and serves a sort of purpose for some time, not just a drawing I'll cast aside.
